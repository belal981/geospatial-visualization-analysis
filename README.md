# geospatial-visualization-analysis
In this notebook, I will show create maps for different objectives. To do that, O will part ways with Matplotlib and work with another Python visualization library, namely **Folium**. What is nice about **Folium** is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as **plotly**, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. **Folium**, on the other hand, is completely free.
